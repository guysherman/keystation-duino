# keystation-duino

An ardino sketch to replace the micro-controller in the M-Audio Keystation 49 with an arudino (cause my one died).

Currently have the basis of a velocity-sensing key matrix implemented. Haven't got on to writing midi events yet.
Originally planned to use a MEGA 2560, but they are a pain for midi, so contemplating updating to either a Due or
a GIGA, but I might just start with ttyMIDI first and see where I get to.
